In the same book, they also showed that using multiple layers of the devices would allow these limitations to be addressed. Unfortunately, only the first of these insights was widely recognized.

Chapter 1 lays out a similar hope to that shown by Rosenblatt:\n",

The authors claimed that the PDP approach was \"closer\n",
        "than other frameworks\" to how the brain works, and therefore it might be better able to handle these kinds of tasks.\n",
        "\n",

And indeed, neural networks were widely used during the '80s and '90s for real, practical projects. However, again a misunderstanding of the theoretical issues held back the field. In theory, adding just one extra layer of neurons was enough to allow any mathematical function to be approximated with these neural networks, but in practice such networks were often too big and too slow to be useful.\n",

You don't teach them how to wind twine to make a baseball from scratch, the physics of a parabola, or the coefficient of friction of a ball on a bat.\n",

Children are not allowed to listen to or play music until they have spent over a decade mastering music notation and theory, spending classes transposing sheet music into a different key. In art class, students study colors and applicators, but aren't allowed to actually paint until college. Sound absurd?

Also, it's expected and normal to not understand everything (especially the code) on first reading. Trying to understand the material serially before proceeding can sometimes be hard.

After PyTorch came out in 2017 we spent over a thousand hours testing it before deciding that we would use it for future courses, software development, and research. Since that time PyTorch has become the world's fastest-growing deep learning library and is already used for most research papers at top conferences. This is generally a leading indicator of usage in industry, because these are the papers that end up getting used in products and services commercially. We have found that PyTorch is the most flexible and expressive library for deep learning. It does not trade off speed for simplicity, but provides both.\n",

For instance, keep reading the next section while your model trains, or open up another notebook and use it for some coding experiments."

As you can see, the model is nearly perfect, even though the training time was only a few seconds (not including the one-time downloading of the dataset and the pretrained model). In fact, the accuracy you've achieved already is far better than anybody had ever achieved just 10 years ago!\n",

That is, if you regard a neural network as a mathematical function, it turns out to be a function which is extremely flexible depending on its weights. A mathematical proof called the *universal approximation theorem* shows that this function can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory. The fact that neural networks are so flexible means that, in practice, they are often a suitable kind of model, and you can focus your effort on the process of training them—that is, of finding good weight assignments.\n",

        "\n",
        "- A model cannot be created without data.\n",
        "- A model can only learn to operate on the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.\n",
        "- This learning approach only creates *predictions*, not recommended *actions*.\n",
        "- It's not enough to just have examples of input data; we need *labels* for that data too (e.g., pictures of dogs and cats aren't enough to train a model; we need a label for each one, saying which ones are dogs, and which are cats).\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally speaking, we've seen that most organizations that say they don't have enough data, actually mean they don't have enough *labeled* data. If any organization is interested in doing something in practice with a model, then presumably they have some inputs they plan to run their model against. And presumably they've been doing that some other way for a while (e.g., manually, or with some heuristic program), so they have data from those processes! For instance, a radiology practice will almost certainly have an archive of medical scans (since they need to be able to check how their patients are progressing over time), but those scans may not have structured labels containing a list of diagnoses or interventions (since radiologists generally create free-text natural language reports, not structured data). We'll be discussing labeling approaches a lot in this book, because it's such an important issue in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since these kinds of machine learning models can only make *predictions* (i.e., attempt to replicate labels), this can result in a significant gap between organizational goals and model capabilities. For instance, in this book you'll learn how to create a *recommendation system* that can predict what products a user might purchase. This is often used in e-commerce, such as to customize products shown on a home page by showing the highest-ranked items. But such a model is generally created by looking at a user and their buying history (*inputs*) and what they went on to buy or look at (*labels*), which means that the model is likely to tell you about products the user already has or already knows about, rather than new products that they are most likely to be interested in hearing about. That's very different to what, say, an expert at your local bookseller might do, where they ask questions to figure out your taste, and then tell you about authors or series that you've never heard of before."

For instance, a video recommendation system might be biased toward recommending content consumed by the biggest watchers of video (e.g., conspiracy theorists and extremists tend to watch more online video content than the average), resulting in those users increasing their video consumption, resulting in more of those kinds of videos being recommended.

This is a really useful class from the Python 3 standard library that makes accessing files and directories much easier.

The filenames start with an uppercase letter if the image is a cat, and a lowercase letter otherwise. We have to tell fastai how to get labels from the filenames, which we do by calling `from_name_func` (which means that labels can be extracted using a function applied to the filename), and passing `is_cat`, which returns `x[0].isupper()`, which evaluates to `True` if the first letter is uppercase (i.e., it's a cat).\n",

By default, the 20% that is held out is selected randomly. The parameter `seed=42` sets the *random seed* to the same value every time we run this code, which means we get the same validation set every time we run it—this way, if we change our model and retrain it, we know that any differences are due to the changes to the model, not due to having a different random validation set.\n",

And of course, this is the data that will actually matter in practice. For instance, if you create a handwritten digit classifier (as we will very soon!) and use it to recognize numbers written on checks, then you are never going to see any of the numbers that the model was trained on—checks will have slightly different variations of writing to deal with. You will learn many methods to avoid overfitting in this book. However, you should only use those methods after you have confirmed that overfitting is actually occurring (i.e., you have actually observed the validation accuracy getting worse during training).

        "There are many different architectures in fastai, which we will introduce in this book (as well as discussing how to create your own). Most of the time, however, picking an architecture isn't a very important part of the deep learning process. It's something that academics love to talk about, but in practice it is unlikely to be something you need to spend much time on. There are some standard architectures that work most of the time, and in this case we're using one called _ResNet_ that we'll be talking a lot about during the book; it is both fast and accurate for many datasets and problems. The `34` in `resnet34` refers to the number of layers in this variant of the architecture (other options are `18`, `50`, `101`, and `152`). Models using architectures with more layers take longer to train, and are more prone to overfitting (i.e. you can't train them for as many epochs before the accuracy on the validation set starts getting worse). On the other hand, when using more data, they can be quite a bit more accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is a metric? A *metric* is a function that measures the quality of the model's predictions using the validation set, and will be printed at the end of each *epoch*. In this case, we're using `error_rate`, which is a function provided by fastai that does just what it says: tells you what percentage of images in the validation set are being classified incorrectly. Another common metric for classification is `accuracy` (which is just `1.0 - error_rate`). fastai provides many more, which will be discussed throughout this book.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of a metric may remind you of *loss*, but there is an important distinction. The entire purpose of loss is to define a \"measure of performance\" that the training system can use to update weights automatically. In other words, a good choice for loss is a choice that is easy for stochastic gradient descent to use. But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand, and that hews as closely as possible to what you want the model to do. At times, you might decide that the loss function is a suitable metric, but that is not necessarily the case."

        "`vision_learner` also has a parameter `pretrained`, which defaults to `True` (so it's used in this case, even though we haven't specified it), which sets the weights in your model to values that have already been trained by experts to recognize a thousand different categories across 1.3 million photos (using the famous [*ImageNet* dataset](http://www.image-net.org/)). A model that has weights that have already been trained on some other dataset is called a *pretrained model*. You should nearly always use a pretrained model, because it means that your model, before you've even shown it any of your data, is already very capable. And, as you'll see, in a deep learning model many of these capabilities are things you'll need, almost regardless of the details of your project. For instance, parts of pretrained models will handle edge, gradient, and color detection, which are needed for many tasks.\n",

This last part of the model is known as the *head*.\n",

The importance of pretrained models is generally not recognized or discussed in most courses, books, or software library features, and is rarely considered in academic papers. As we write this at the start of 2020, things are just starting to change, but it's likely to take a while. So be careful: most people you speak to will probably greatly underestimate what you can do in deep learning with few resources, because they probably won't deeply understand how to use pretrained models.\n",

Unfortunately, because transfer learning is so under-studied, few domains have pretrained models available.

The number of epochs you select will largely depend on how much time you have available, and how long you find it takes in practice to fit your model.

        "With this vocabulary in hand, we are now in a position to bring together all the key concepts introduced so far. Take a moment to review those definitions and read the following summary. If you can follow the explanation, then you're well equipped to understand the discussions to come.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Machine learning* is a discipline where we define a program not by writing it entirely ourselves, but by learning from data. *Deep learning* is a specialty within machine learning that uses *neural networks* with multiple *layers*. *Image classification* is a representative example (also known as *image recognition*). We start with *labeled data*; that is, a set of images where we have assigned a *label* to each image indicating what it represents. Our goal is to produce a program, called a *model*, which, given a new image, will make an accurate *prediction* regarding what that new image represents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every model starts with a choice of *architecture*, a general template for how that kind of model works internally. The process of *training* (or *fitting*) the model is the process of finding a set of *parameter values* (or *weights*) that specialize that general architecture into a model that works well for our particular kind of data. In order to define how well a model does on a single prediction, we need to define a *loss function*, which determines how we score a prediction as good or bad.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make the training process go faster, we might start with a *pretrained model*—a model that has already been trained on someone else's data. We can then adapt it to our data by training it a bit more on our data, a process called *fine-tuning*.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we train a model, a key concern is to ensure that our model *generalizes*—that is, that it learns general lessons from our data which also apply to new items it will encounter, so that it can make good predictions on those items. The risk is that if we train our model badly, instead of learning general lessons it effectively memorizes what it has already seen, and then it will make poor predictions about new images. Such a failure is called *overfitting*. In order to avoid this, we always divide our data into two parts, the *training set* and the *validation set*. We train the model by showing it only the training set and then we evaluate how well the model is doing by seeing how well it performs on items from the validation set. In this way, we check if the lessons the model learns from the training set are lessons that generalize to the validation set. In order for a person to assess how well the model is doing on the validation set overall, we define a *metric*. During the training process, when the model has seen every item in the training set, we call that an *epoch*.\n",
        "\n",
        "All these concepts apply to machine learning in general. That is, they apply to all sorts of schemes for defining a model by training it with data. What makes deep learning distinctive is a particular class of architectures: the architectures based on *neural networks*. In particular, tasks like image classification rely heavily on *convolutional neural networks*, which we will discuss shortly."

        "In a Jupyter notebook, the order in which you execute each cell is very important. It's not like Excel, where everything gets updated as soon as you type something anywhere—it has an inner state that gets updated each time you execute a cell. For instance, when you run the first cell of the notebook (with the \"CLICK ME\" comment), you create an object called `learn` that contains a model and data for an image classification problem. If we were to run the cell just shown in the text (the one that predicts if a review is good or not) straight after, we would get an error as this `learn` object does not contain a text classification model. This cell needs to be run after the one containing:\n",

In machine learning and deep learning, we can’t do anything without data. So, the people that create datasets for us to train our models on are the (often underappreciated) heroes. Some of the most useful and important datasets are those that become important *academic baselines*; that is, datasets that are widely studied by researchers and used to compare algorithmic changes. Some of these become household names (at least, among households that train models!), such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.\n",

For instance, later in the book we’ll be showing you how to create a model that can translate between French and English. The key input to this is a French/English parallel text corpus prepared back in 2009 by Professor Chris Callison-Burch of the University of Pennsylvania. This dataset contains over 20 million sentence pairs in French and English. He built the dataset in a really clever way: by crawling millions of Canadian web pages (which are often multilingual) and then using a set of simple heuristics to transform URLs of French content onto URLs pointing to the same content in English.\n",

If we trained a model with all our data, and then evaluated the model using that same data, we would not be able to tell how well our model can perform on data it hasn’t seen. Without this very valuable piece of information to guide us in training our model, there is a very good chance it would become good at making predictions about that data but would perform poorly on new data.\n",

This lets us test that the model learns lessons from the training data that generalize to new data, the validation data.\n",

Instead, we are likely to explore many versions of a model through various modeling choices regarding network architecture, learning rates, data augmentation strategies, and other factors we will discuss in upcoming chapters. Many of these choices can be described as choices of *hyperparameters*. The word reflects that they are parameters about parameters, since they are the higher-level choices that govern the meaning of the weight parameters."

We, as modelers, are evaluating the model by looking at predictions on the validation data when we decide to explore new hyperparameter values! So subsequent versions of the model are, indirectly, shaped by us having seen the validation data. Just as the automatic training process is in danger of overfitting the training data, we are in danger of overfitting the validation data through human trial and error and exploration.\n",

        "The solution to this conundrum is to introduce another level of even more highly reserved data, the *test set*. Just as we hold back the validation data from the training process, we must hold back the test set data even from ourselves. It cannot be used to improve the model; it can only be used to evaluate the model at the very end of our efforts. In effect, we define a hierarchy of cuts of our data, based on how fully we want to hide it from training and modeling processes: training data is fully exposed, the validation data is less exposed, and test data is totally hidden. This hierarchy parallels the different kinds of modeling and evaluation processes themselves—the automatic training process with back propagation, the more manual process of trying different hyper-parameters between training sessions, and the assessment of our final result.\n",
        "\n",
        "The test and validation sets should have enough data to ensure that you get a good estimate of your accuracy. If you're creating a cat detector, for instance, you generally want at least 30 cats in your validation set. That means that if you have a dataset with thousands of items, using the default 20% validation set size may be more than you need. On the other hand, if you have lots of data, using some of it for validation probably doesn't have any downsides.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having two levels of \"reserved data\"—a validation set and a test set, with one level representing data that you are virtually hiding from yourself—may seem a bit extreme. But the reason it is often necessary is because models tend to gravitate toward the simplest way to do good predictions (memorization), and we as fallible humans tend to gravitate toward fooling ourselves about how well our models are performing. The discipline of the test set helps us keep ourselves intellectually honest. That doesn't mean we *always* need a separate test set—if you have very little data, you may need to just have a validation set—but generally it's best to use one if at all possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "This same discipline can be critical if you intend to hire a third party to perform modeling work on your behalf. A third party might not understand your requirements accurately, or their incentives might even encourage them to misunderstand them. A good test set can greatly mitigate these risks and let you evaluate whether their work solves your actual problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it bluntly, if you're a senior decision maker in your organization (or you're advising senior decision makers), the most important takeaway is this: if you ensure that you really understand what test and validation sets are and why they're important, then you'll avoid the single biggest source of failures we've seen when organizations decide to use AI. For instance, if you're considering bringing in an external vendor or service, make sure that you hold out some test data that the vendor *never gets to see*. Then *you* check their model on your test data, using a metric that *you* choose based on what actually matters to you in practice, and *you* decide what level of performance is adequate. (It's also a good idea for you to try out some simple baseline yourself, so you know what a really simple model can achieve. Often it'll turn out that your simple model performs just as well as one produced by an external \"expert\"!)"

If you would like to start learning the foundations of how deep learning works under the hood, skip to <<chapter_mnist_basics>>. (Did you ever read _Choose Your Own Adventure_ books as a kid? Well, this is kind of like that… except with more deep learning than that book series contained.)\n",
